## Introduction

With these cards you're going to make a to-do list web app. You'll be able to use this app to track whatever you want: cool programming tricks you want to learn, places to go, songs to listen to (or learn to play!), or just something as simple as things to pick up at the shops.

### What you will make

This is an example of the app you'll be making:

<div class="app-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="450px" height="450px" src="https://philipharney.github.io/to-do-list/" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

You can add and remove to-do items from the list, and also save them so they reload for you later.

### What you will learn

  - Using an online editor to create and modify JavaScript
  - Creating your own JavaScript functions
  - Listening for different user actions on a web page
  - Using functions together to write code more professionally
  - Saving user information between visits to your web page
