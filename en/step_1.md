## Introduction

In these cards you're going to make the to-do list app. This app can be used to track whatever you want: cool programming tricks you want to learn, places to go, songs to listen to (or learn to play!), or something as simple as things to pick up at the shops.

### What you will make

This is an example of the app you'll be making:

<div class="app-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="450px" height="450px" src="https://philipharney.github.io/to-do-list/" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

You can add and remove to-do items from the list and even save them so they reload for you later.

### What you will learn

  - Using an online editor to create and modify JavaScript
  - Creating your own JavaScript functions
  - Listening to different user actions on the web page
  - Using functions together to write code more professionally
  - Saving user's information between visits to your website
