## Introduction

In these cards you're going to make the to-do app you can see at [dojo.soy/js-todo](http://dojo.soy/js-todo). This app can be used to track whatever you want: cool programming tricks you want to learn, places to go, songs to listen to (or learn to play!), or something as simple as things to pick up at the shops.

These are the Intermediate Sushi Cards, so I'll sometimes tell you to do things without showing you how they're done. In those cases, they're almost always something that you can see in the Beginner JavaScript Sushi Cards.


### What you will make

Add something here to showcase here, for example:

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/160619869/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Add instructions here. These should explain either how the finished project will work, or explain how to interact with the content above.
